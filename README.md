Number Detection with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on number detection using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a widely used dataset in image processing and computer vision for number recognition tasks.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network that accurately classifies images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) into their respective numeric labels. This project demonstrates the fundamental steps in deep learning, from data preprocessing and model creation to training, evaluation, and testing.

Key Features
Dataset: Utilizes the MNIST dataset of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits.
Model Architecture: A simple, fully connected neural network (ANN) model built using TensorFlow and Keras.
Preprocessing: Images are flattened and normalized to enhance model performance and reduce computational complexity.
Training and Evaluation: The model is trained with the training set and validated on the validation set. Key metrics include accuracy and loss.
Testing: Final evaluation of the model's performance on unseen test data to assess generalization.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow and Keras
NumPy and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
